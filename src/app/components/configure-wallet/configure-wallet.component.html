      When you create a new wallet, a new Nano seed will be generated which can be used to create brand new accounts

      <p>Make sure you back up your seed, write it down, and keep it incredibly safe!  There is NO way to recover it after

      If you already have a Nano wallet, you can use your backup seed to import it below.  When you import a seed,
      none of your existing wallets or accounts are affected, and your seed
      is not stored anywhere besides in your local client.<br>
      <br>
      After importing your seed, you will need to 're-create' your accounts.  Don't worry - all of your accounts are
      the same and your funds have not disappeared.  Just go to the accounts section and press create new account to load
      your accounts.
